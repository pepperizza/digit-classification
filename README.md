# digit-classification

## Overview
This repository contains machine learning exercises for digit classification using the load_digits dataset from scikit-learn.

## Dataset
The load_digits dataset is a collection included in the scikit-learn library containing 1797 images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is represented as an 8x8 matrix of grayscale intensity values.
Dataset characteristics:

Number of samples: 1797
Image dimensions: 8x8 pixels
Classes: 10 digits (0-9)
Features: 64 (pixel intensity values)

## Techniques implemented
Logistic Regression:
- model evaluation for multiclass classification
- confusion matrix
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
- performance evaluation and mistaken classified examples

## Requirements
python >= 3.6
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
jupyter notebook
seaborn
